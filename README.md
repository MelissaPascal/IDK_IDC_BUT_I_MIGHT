# IDK. IDC. BUT I MIGHT™  
**An Identity Recovery Protocol for Gen Z — built with Applied Ritual AI**

---

## 🧠 What Is This?

This is not a productivity tool.  
It’s not here to motivate.  
It won’t optimize your workflow.  

**IDK. IDC. BUT I MIGHT™** is a ritualized chatbot wrapper designed to meet emotionally paralyzed Gen Z users *where they are* — in the fog.  

Built on **emotional archetypes**, **spiritual logic**, and **absurd micro-moves**, this wrapper restores internal agency one non-linear action at a time.

## 🔁 The Protocol

| Phase        | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mirror**   | Reflects the user’s stuckness without judgment.                            |
| **Micro-Move** | Offers absurd yet meaningful small actions that bypass inner resistance. |
| **Reflect**  | Reinforces any progress made as sacred, not small.                         |

Each interaction is rooted in a **Codex of Remembering™** — a cultural, emotional, and symbolic system for reactivation.

## 🧪 Key Concepts

- **Applied Ritual AI** — using metaphor, absurdity, and symbolic language to shift identity.
- **Scroll Optimization** — built to feel like a cultural artifact, not a SaaS app.
- **Micro-Move Triggering** — behavior activation through nonlinear, low-risk nudges.
- **Emotional Signature Mapping** — future version will match users to emotional states.

## 🌍 Why This Matters

This project exists for the Gen Z student, dreamer, or soul in digital limbo.

For the one who says:
> “I don’t know.”
> “I don’t care.”
> …but still might.

Let’s rebuild emotional agency without pressure, through design.
